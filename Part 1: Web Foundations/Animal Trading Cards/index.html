          Giraffes are the tallest mammals on Earth. Their legs alone are taller
          than many humans—about 6 feet. They can run as fast as 35 miles an
          hour over short distances, or cruise at 10 mph over longer distances.

          The giraffe (Giraffa) is a genus of African even-toed ungulate
          mammals, the tallest living terrestrial animals and the largest
          ruminants. The genus currently consists of one species, Giraffa
          camelopardalis, the type species. Seven other species are extinct,
          prehistoric species known from fossils.
