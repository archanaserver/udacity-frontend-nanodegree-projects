I have already blog about my first phase of this scholarship. You can read from here [**Grow with Google (Part 1)**](https://medium.com/@archanaserver/grow-with-google-652c87dc5fce).

So, this was all about phase 1 of this scholarship. I got selected in phase 2 and this is all it started:

## **Grow with Google #Part2**

One of the happiest day, when I had recieved the mail from Udacity that _I am selected for phase 2_ and earned a _full 6-month Google India Developer Nanodegree Scholarship to_ Front- End Web Developer Nanodegree. It wasn't easy for me to maintain both college semester exams and Udacity courses but as we say hardwork pays. I was able to complete it both with excellency.

On 29th of May my first day in Nanodegree classroom, I was extremely excited to get into the classroom and to learn more and more about WEB DEVELOPEMENT.

I believe that -

### **Welcome in Classroom** :

I was surprised 😍 because there are so many learning stuffs available for every single Udacity Nanodegree students like-

- Core Curriculum
- Extracurricular
- Classroom Mentor
- Project Reviews
- Knowledge Section
- Carrer Portal
- Chatting section with students

All these features attracted me to be more enthusiastic in the course. We had slack workspace for communications and to help each other, so that's why I took an advantages of all these features and started my journey in this program. I can say that 6 months Nanodegree course was awesome and exciting journey for me :). The best part of doing any work is to get target and challenges and thats what Nanodegree has given us that is to complete all of our labs and projects on time.

### **Student Moderator** 😎

I always wanted to be moderator because it gives us the power to lead someone. It was one of the good day I can say that when our mentor Venkata sir announced on the Slack about Moderation Selection information and form just like phase 1. I had filled the form for the #ama_sessions and why I want this. After few days announcement for selected moderator and guess what?? 
Yes!! I got selected to be Student Moderator for two channels of slack #ama_sessions and #fend_build_react. I was so happy :). Even got the awesome frame for identification of Student Moderator.

### **Project Completion Challenge begins** 🎉 

Apart from all these the most exciting announcement for every single peer of ND when our mentor Akshit Jain sir announced the Project Completion Challenge- As a name suggests, **it's sort of like a competition that will have with peers**. The courses project will have to complete, even make it as awesome as possible in order to showcase to the world by posting it in the social sites and pass the project in the deadline given by the Akshit sir. I was super excited to take part in FEND Project Completion Challenges. I had taken part in few project completion challenges, completed the project within the given deadline. Project Completion Challenge #1 and Mobile Developer fest Edition. And got the opportunity for getting selected as a Panel Speaker for MDF but sadly I wan't able to qualify that interview round. I can say that being an introvert, it was so difficult for me to even take part in this challenge daily post your progress about that project.

I have completed the Project and got an awesome review from Udacity reviewer side and total 28 suggestions that's the thing I love in the review section, the suggestions are awesome and helps me a lot to learn new things. I had tweet my daily progress related to that project in Twitter, even share in LinkedIn and Instagram and daily I got so many positive responses from social peoples and from my friends, that pushes me more towards the challenge. And now I think that one-

> "Inspiration helps us to get Aspiration"

### **Winner Announcement and Prizes** 🎁

Yeah! the day announcement of the winner has come, I was waiting for winner announcement day just to see who is the winner, I didn't even know about that I won the project challenge competition but when I read my name I was like OMG 😳.

I worked in it to increase my progress, learn new things and that worked, not because to win the challenge I worked in it with a positive attitude and follow all the rules given by Akshit sir. Now all these things ignite me more and more towards my goal.❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
For me the key to success is-

> "Believing in yourself is the first secret to success."

Won these two challenges _Project Completion Challenge #1 and Mobile Developer fest Edition_. And got the opportunity for getting selected as a Panel Speaker for MDF but sadly I wasn't able to qualify that interview round. I can say that being an introvert, it was so difficult for me to even take part in this challenge daily post your progress about that project.

Announcement of winners- find me as @archanaserver

I'm really feeling blessed to be a part of Google Udacity Scholar family. I have learned lots of things from the phase 1 and phase 2 scholarship and happy that I was in such a great community of Google Udacity Scholars everyone helped me a lot.

Yay! That's all about my journey. It was drafted on my medium account from last two years so I thought to add this here.🙈
