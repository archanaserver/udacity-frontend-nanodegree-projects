# How I built the Memory Game?

For building memory game project I used HTML CSS and JAVASCRIPT. Also styled the game created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched create a pop-up modal when player wins game.
